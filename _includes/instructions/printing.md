To get the best results, print the PDFs at 100% scale. They’re designed to print at full size, so make sure to disable any “Fit to Page” or “Auto-Scale” settings in your preferred PDF application or printer settings dialog. This will ensure that your printout matches the intended layout and dimensions exactly.

### Tip - Label Paper

Consider using either printable paper sticker sheets or printable metallic vinyl adhesive sheets. The metallic vinyl option closely resembles some of 
the original labels. Keep in mind that labels with white backgrounds allow the metallic sheen to shine through, while opaque colours — such as black or yellow gradients — may mask the metallic effect.
